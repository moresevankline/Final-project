# Python-Final-Project
* A final project for the course CS - 121 Advance Computer Programming.

## Hospital Management System
* Hospital Management System is a system created using Python. It performs CRUD operation to manage informations and also apply OOP principles.


## Console Mode
* This console application consist of two Modes: Admin Mode and User Mode
* This console application is coded in Python Programming Language and is useful when managing datas.

## Features 
* Feature 1: Allows user to manage and manipulate datas for Doctors.

* Feature 2: Allows user to manage and manipulate datas for Patients.

* Feature 3: Allows user to view the hospital informations

## To run:
* Open the file named app.py to start the runtime of the system by basically running this file.

* The console application will then appear, along with a screen asking which commands will be used by the administrator, which are Admin mode, User mode, and Exit.

* After accessing the login screen, the console application will provide you a option  which will you choose from Admin mode or User mode.

* The screen will show the choices for Admin mode and User mode. For the Admin mode you have a choice where you can choose to manange patients or to manage doctors. Meanwhile by choosing user mode, you will have the options to view hospital departments, hospital doctors, patients' residents and patients' details

* Admin mode enables the user of the system to add and access information regarding the patients and doctors inside the database records. While the user mode's feature is to display the current datas available inside the database such as the hospital departments, hospital doctors, patients' residents and patient's details.

* If either the administrator or the user enters an invalid value, the console will detect the error and prompt the administrator or user to try again.

## Self-Assessment
|Metric| Score| Description|
|:--------:|:----:|:----------------------:|
|Code Reusablity|4|Practices DRY (Do not Repeat Yourself) method excellently, leading to a shorter and cleaner program structure.|
|Maintainablity|4|The program's structure is based on OOP principles, Codes are readable, understandable, aiding to its maintainability.|
|Scalability|3|The program can be easily updated in case of feature add-ons and immediate tweaks.|
|Execution|4|The program is fully functional as declared and intended with additional features that exceeds the requirements of the course. Handling of errors are remarkably done. Some operations even use appropriate algorithms to improve cost-efficiency and overall performance.|
|Originality|3|Concept is quite similar to some samples.|
|Overall Impression|3|Minimal to no bugs or error found during presentation. The overall quality and creativity are good.|
